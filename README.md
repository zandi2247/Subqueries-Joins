<h1>Creating a report that displays customers by points</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This Portion of the project is writing a query in MYSQL to join different tables and columns to produce a report that displays the customers id, first name, and how many points they have. Those customers are then seperated into different categories (bronze, silver, and gold) broze being customers who have less than 2000 points, silver being customers who have between 2000 and 3000 points, and gold being customers who have greater than 3000 points. The results of those queries are then ordered by first name. This report dispalys my ability to write strings, joins, unions,and understand basic MYSQL functions at a high level.
